# MyFavLocation
Users can save name, type, comment and location of their favorite places and can open navigation to their favorite places, inspired by Atıl Samancıoğlu lectures. In this project, Parse with Back4app were used to save and get the data for places that are saved by users. Users can see their favorite places in table view of the main screen. They can save their favorite place locations by pressing to the map for 2 seconds by adding annotation, and after saving, they can see their comment and can get navigation for the places they saved.
